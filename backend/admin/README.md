<h1 align="center">Github Robber - Admin API</h1>
<p align="center"><strong>A simple admin panel to ease administrative functions in GitHub Robber.</strong></p>

<h2>Setup Instructions</h2>

*Since the Admin API is still a work in progress and has yet to be integrated in with the main app components, It has separate setup requirements that only slightly differ from the main backend/requirements.txt. It is also easier to 'try out', in the meantime, due to its isolation*

<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
<ol>
  <p>i. <i>Have admin_api folder-content downloaded</i> </p>
<p>ii. <i>Have Virtual Enviroment set up, activated, and ready to.</i> </p>
<p>iii. <i>Navigate to admin_api folder</i> </p>
</ol>



<h4>1. Make sure requirements are installed in Virtual Env.</h4>
  <code>> pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
<ol>
  <i>if requirements.txt does not install properly, manually tell pip to install flask, flask_sqlaclhemy, and flask_admin</i>
</ol>
<h4>2. Run the app with python</h4>
  <code>> python admin_api.py</code>
